-- total number of flights

-- average amount of seats

-- average amount of flight miles per cst status group
SELECT

-- max number of flight miles per cst status group

-- list of flights with a distance between 300 and 2000 miles
SELECT flight_number, flight_mileage

--------- dont understand the wording of the problem
---- the average distance per cst group??
SELECT
    c.cust_status,
    AVG(f.flight_mileage) AS average_flight_mileage
FROM customers c
JOIN flights f ON c.cust_flight_number = f.flight_number
GROUP BY c.cust_status;
